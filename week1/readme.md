# Week 1

### WHAT IS CREATIVE CODING?

Creative Coding is using programming languages to re-design, illustrate, and interact with your environment.

#### Common Creative Coding libraries/environments

* Java/Processing
* C++/Cinder
* C++/openFrameworks
* Javascript/p5js
* Max/Msp
* Puredata

### WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?  

Is a interpreted programming language, which executes instructions directly, instead of compiled or preprocessed. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production. Javascript can be ran in the browser, desktop, and server.

### WHAT IS CANVAS?

The canvas tag is a new html5 tag that lets you draw and animate graphics in a web browser. It allows programmers using javascript to create graphics programatically.

### WHAT IS A LIBRARY?

A collection of code instructions that facilitate the implementation of specific tasks

### WHAT IS P5JS?

p5js is a javascript library based off Java/Processing. It was developed by Lauren McCarthy. Java/Processing was developed to easily teach and program graphics. p5js was made possible because of the introduction of the html5 Canvas tag and the popularity of Processing.

### Brackets

Brackets is a text editor. [http://brackets.io/](http://brackets.io/)

### File Structure

* CIM540-640 Folder
 * week1
  * Assignments, notes, etc
  * readme.md
 * week2
  * Assignments, notes, etc
  * readme.md

  All assignments should have a readme.md with a general description of what you did for the assignment. All assignments need to have a codeplan.

### Codeplan

A codeplan is documentation of how your program works. It should breakdown how the user interacts with your assignment step by step.

#### Example

The goal for this program is for the user to fill in a form and it generates a series of floating bubbles on the screen.

Step 1: User fills form
Step 2: User clicks submit
Step 3: Grab information from form
Step 4: Generate bubbles
Step 5: Move bubbles

Additional goals: Create a reset button

### WHAT IS GIT?

Git is a free and open source version control system/software. Once you initialize git in a directory, it tracks changes in your code. This is called initializing a repository.

Their are severial ways you can use git:

* command line
* gui interface / Github Desktop for Mac/PC
 * Note: When installing Github Desktop make sure you install command line tools.
 * Under the programs preferences you will need to add your github credentials.
* [Brackets Git](https://github.com/zaggino/brackets-git) - Install as a plugin on brackets

### WHAT IS GITHUB?

Github is a service that hosts git repositories remotely. It is like a Dropbox or Google Drive for code. Once you initialize your repository you can link it with a github repository. The easiest way to create a repository and link it is with the Github Desktop app. Below you’ll see how to create a local repo and upload it to Github.

### WHAT IS A GIST?

Gists are part of github. They are a quick way to share code with out having to create a repository. They are hosted on github but are not local to your computer. Gists are useful for quickly sending code when something is not working or sharing/working on snippets of code


### Common Git Terminal Commands

#### git init

When creating a repository from scratch you need to call git init to start git

#### git status

Tells you the current status of you repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git

If you have already created a repository you can use git clone to copy that repository from github to your computer
Your general workflow when using git, will be navigating to your repo folder and executing these commands.

#### git add .

Will add all the changes you have made since your last commit.

#### git commit -m “your commit”

This will save your changes

#### git push origin master

If configured correctly, will upload your changes to github.
