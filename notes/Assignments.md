 This is a mobile application that depending on my mood lets me blend the perfect coffee cup. When the application opens it will first prompt you what mood your are in. The next screen will ask you a level or refinement. If you are happy, How happy are you from 1-10. Once your mood is selected. The application will prompt you where would you like your coffee brewed. Once confirmed your perfect cup of coffee will be brewed at your desired location.
